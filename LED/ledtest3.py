# Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a way to get an artificial analog output on a digital pin.
# It achieves this by rapidly toggling the pin from low to high. There are two parameters
# associated with this: the frequency of the toggling, and the duty cycle.
# The duty cycle is defined to be how long the pin is high compared with the length of a
# single period (low plus high time). Maximum duty cycle is when the pin is high all of the
# time, and minimum is when it is low all of the time.

# control I/O pins
# machine.Pin(id, mode=- 1, pull=- 1, *, value, drive, alt)
# Access the pin peripheral (GPIO pin) associated with the given id.
# If additional arguments are given in the constructor then they are used to initialise
# the pin. Any settings that are not specified will remain in their previous state.
